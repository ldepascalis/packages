Description: After the user has specified a string, or a string vector, with names of desired packages, the function checks the names correspond to those of packages available on CRAN. If it finds that some of the specified names do not correspond to available packages, the user is given the choice of loading the remaining packages. After this initial check the function checks whether the packages are installed, and, if not, installs them before loading them.
